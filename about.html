<h2>Our Story</h2>
<p><strong>Cariad Crochet</strong> was born from a love of slow craft, soft textures, and the comforting rhythm of crochet. “Cariad” — the Welsh word for love — captures the heart of everything we make: thoughtful, handmade pieces created with care and connection.</p>
<p>Each baby bonnet is lovingly crocheted by hand in Wales, using high-quality, natural yarns that are gentle on delicate skin. Every stitch tells a story — one of warmth, heritage, and modern simplicity.</p>

<h2>Made in Wales</h2>
<p>Our studio is tucked between the Welsh hills and coastal winds, where tradition and creativity meet. Every bonnet carries a little piece of that landscape — crafted slowly, sustainably, and with joy.</p>
<p>We’re proud to support local suppliers, use eco-friendly packaging, and keep production small and personal. Because to us, handmade means made with heart.</p>
